Using the vscode Debugger Demo

- Create a breakpoint by clicking on the left side of the line numbers. A red dot will show up
- Breakpoints can be created anytime, also while debugging
- Once you have a breakpoint, run the code with the green Play button or press F5
- Watch the Variables on the left part
- Continue (F5): continue with the program until the next breakpoint or until the program finishes
- Step over (F10): continue with the next line even if it has no breakpoint
- Restart: restart the debugging from the beginning
- Stop: stop the debugging

Debug this code to understand what it does and find out what the mysterious variables are!
Hint: what is the purpose of line 21?
